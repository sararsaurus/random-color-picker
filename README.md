This is an adaptation of a [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-react-introduction/projects/random-color) program that helps designers think of new color schemes. The inspiration for this kind of creativity-inducing project is [Oblique Strategies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_Strategies), a card-based method first published in 1975 designed to encourage lateral thinking.

My unique tweaks include:

- A buildout using Vite
- Updates to the legacy React code
