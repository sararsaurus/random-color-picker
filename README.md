This project is (very) loosely based on an old [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-react-introduction/projects/random-color) program that helps designers think of new color schemes; the concept is inspired by [Oblique Strategies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_Strategies), a card-based method first published in 1975 designed to encourage lateral thinking.

The Codecademy version defines components as classes rather than as functions and features some other legacy React code. This code is more of a redo than a refactor - it doesn't really use any of the Codecademy code - but it shows the magic of React Hooks + dynamic styling, which allowed me to cut the lines of code nearly in half.
